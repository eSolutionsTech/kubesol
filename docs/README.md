# Kubesol

## What is Kubesol

_Kubesol_ is a [free and open-source](../LICENSE.md) Kubernetes distribution
with optional commercial support and / or license by [esolutions.tech](https://www.esolutions.tech/kubesol).

After creating the required Virtual Machines (VMs) and running the installer, the end product is a Kubernetes cluster with many useful and popular components installed (full list below).

## Here are the main advantages that make our product a standout choice:
- **Free and Open-Source, just as our MOTTO** Enjoy the benefits of a cost-effective solution with the option for premium commercial support if needed.
- **Streamlined Installation**: Simplify your setup with a repeatable installation and configuration process, all driven by efficient Ansible playbooks.
- **Seamless Kubernetes Management**: Easily create and upgrade Kubernetes clusters with the reliable RKE2 system. Learn more at RKE2 GitHub.
- **Pre-Configured Storage Classes**: Benefit from built-in Longhorn and DirectPV storage classes, ready to go out of the box.
- **Comprehensive Kubernetes Components**: Start with the most common Kubernetes components already configured, saving you time and effort. See the full list below.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Access detailed documentation and example usage guides for a wide range of components, ensuring you have all the support you need.
- **User-Friendly**: Operate with ease, requiring only minimal knowledge of Ansible, kubectl, and Helm, making it accessible even for DevOps professionals with limited experience.
